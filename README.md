# Website Mini Project

This is a basic website project where the goal is to make an educational/blog website where I can potentially write and update content on various topics regularly as I learn more about them. It is supposed to be a platfrom where I explain difficult to understand topics in an intuitive manner.

## problems with the current front end:

<ul>
<li>The links in the animated dropdown don't work because as soon as I add an anchor tag to them, they lose their formatting due to css selector precedence issues. Inefficient css code and multiple css files with overlapping code makes it difficult to track the issue.</li>
<li>Can access those pages through the "Get started" button that shows up when we hover over the picture of the digital electronics topic on the main page</li>
</ul>
